# Rusty Linux Commands

This repository contains a collection of Linux commands implemented in Rust programming language. Each command is designed to replicate the functionality of its Linux counterpart while being written in Rust for learning and practice purposes.

## Commands Implemented
- **`ls`**: List directory contents
- **`pwd`**: Print name of current/working directory
- **`mkdir`**: Make directories

*(This list will be updated as more commands are implemented)*

## Usage
To use any command, clone the repository and compile the Rust source files using Rust compiler.

Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tt-abdulhaq/rusty-linux-commands.git
cd rusty-linux-commands/command_name
cargo build --release
./target/release/command_name [arguments]
